        Hi there,
      </p>
      <p className={getParagraphClass({ responsive: true, muted: true })}>
        I'm Joe (@obukofejoe), a data scientist, gamer and a full-time selective
        yapper living in Lagos, Nigeria. I'm currently at PremiumTrust Bank as a
        Data Scientist - Product and doing my masters at the University of
        Stirling, Scotland.
      </p>
      <p className={getAllowanceClass({ axis: "py" })}></p>
      <h3 className={getHeadingClass(3, { responsive: true })}>(Extended)</h3>
      <p className={getParagraphClass({ responsive: true, muted: true })}>
        Hi â€” again.
      </p>
      <p className={getParagraphClass({ responsive: true, muted: true })}>
        If there's one thing that really anchors how I live and learn, it's a
        phrase I hold close:
      </p>
      <p className={getParagraphClass({ responsive: true, muted: true })}>
        <i>Poco a Poco</i>, meaning <i>"Little by Little"</i> in Spanish.
      </p>
      <p className={getParagraphClass({ responsive: true, muted: true })}>
        This alone is my whole damn way of moving through life, and it's more or
        less how I intentionally think about growth, and how I learn. It's also
        how I choose to build, with intention, in extremely fine granularity and
        piece by piece, with less noise and more signal.
      </p>
      <p className={getParagraphClass({ responsive: true, muted: true })}>
        But here's the thing, I'm still learning. I didn't always know how to do
        "little by little." For years, I'd throw myself headfirst into seemingly
        important stuff, consuming everything all at once, burning out while at
        it, then wondering why I felt hollow afterward. I remember spending
        months trying to understand every aspect of machine learning, barely
        getting enough sleep, only to realize I couldn't actually build anything
        meaningful with all that scattered knowledge. That's when poco a poco
        stopped being just a nice phrase and started becoming an actual survival
        strategy.
      </p>
      <p className={getAllowanceClass({ axis: "py" })}></p>
      <h3 className={getHeadingClass(3, { responsive: true })}>
        I don't like doing things on the surface.
      </h3>
      <p className={getParagraphClass({ responsive: true, muted: true })}>
        While I'm not repulsed by it, it's also something I constantly try not
        to do whenever I get the chance to, and not also because I think depth
        is always better, but because I simply can't help but to go there. I get
        extremely fidgety around things that feel too shallow or half-baked,
        whether it's a function, or something as simple as a thought or even
        something as nuanced as star formation. My way of moving through with it
        is to comprehensively understand it from the inside out, not out of the
        need for perfectionism, but because I absolutely care enough to know.
      </p>
      <p className={getParagraphClass({ responsive: true, muted: true })}>
        But there's a part of me I'm learning to embrace, and it is that depth
        doesn't mean overdoing, but rather being intentional and possibly
        structured when it makes sense, and maybe a tad understandably chaotic
        if it doesn't.
      </p>
      <p className={getAllowanceClass({ axis: "py" })}></p>
      <h3 className={getHeadingClass(3, { responsive: true })}>
        The internet feels like noise these days, and honestly, I think that's
        part of what drives my need for depth.
      </h3>
      <p className={getParagraphClass({ responsive: true, muted: true })}>
        It's crowded and overstimulating, and everyone's always either
        optimizing, scaling, or shipping stuff and it gets hard to breathe
        sometimes, harder to focus if even. Don't even get me started on the
        whole doomscrolling stuff, but the really weird (and maybe relatable)
        thing about it is that I love being deep in the chaos. There's something
        oddly reassuring about carving your own personal corner of the internet
        that feels "you", with zero pressure and all-in presence.
      </p>
      <p className={getParagraphClass({ responsive: true, muted: true })}>
        This site is precisely that for me. A slow, zero-pressure archive that's
        all part me, a digital log of everything and anything I deeply care
        about, put together with mini-batches of hard-earned clarity. I built
        this because I needed a place where I could come back and remember how
        much I've grown, and where I could trace the messy, non-linear path from
        who I was to who I'm becoming.
      </p>
      <p className={getAllowanceClass({ axis: "py" })}></p>
      <h3 className={getHeadingClass(3, { responsive: true })}>
        Most of what I do now is self-guided, which is both liberating and
        terrifying.
      </h3>
      <p className={getParagraphClass({ responsive: true, muted: true })}>
        I make my own roadmaps, decide what to learn, how to learn it, and worry
        less about the "what for". I would definitely be meticulous, but not
        always methodical about it. Although I try, I firmly believe in
        wandering sometimes too.
      </p>
      <p className={getParagraphClass({ responsive: true, muted: true })}>
        I think structure can be a double-edged sword, helpful yes, but also
        stifling sometimes. Most times, my best learning journeys didn't come
        from perfect plans but from getting completely lost in something I
        didn't fully understand, but still following it anyways.
      </p>
      <p className={getAllowanceClass({ axis: "py" })}></p>
      <h3 className={getHeadingClass(3, { responsive: true })}>
        I strongly believe obsession beats discipline.
      </h3>
      <p className={getParagraphClass({ responsive: true, muted: true })}>
        I know it's not a popular take in the era of hustle and productivity
        culture, but for me, obsession isn't always about burnout, but the joy
        that comes with it. I've done some of my best work not because I was
        told to, but mainly because I couldn't not do it.
      </p>
      <p className={getParagraphClass({ responsive: true, muted: true })}>
        That's why I'll always choose learning what truly excites me over what's
        trendy. It's not exactly discipline but something much more primal.
      </p>
      <p className={getAllowanceClass({ axis: "py" })}></p>
      <h3 className={getHeadingClass(3, { responsive: true })}>
        I am painfully reminded of the fact that I am a slow learner.
      </h3>
      <p className={getParagraphClass({ responsive: true, muted: true })}>
        I constantly go over the same lessons and need far more time than I'd
        like to finally "get it." And I get super jealous of people who can just
        breeze through new concepts as if their minds were wired differently
        (which might be the case), as for the longest time, I always prioritized
        breadth over depth. But I've also come to feel that it's a pretty
        underrated superpower. Being "slow" forces me to be deliberate. It means
        that when something sticks, it really sticks. It also allows me to work
        things out at my own pace, and truthfully, I'm slow at almost everything
        in life, not just in learning. I eat slowly, I process slowly, I even
        walk slower than most people I know. It used to frustrate me, because in
        a world that worships speed, being slow feels like being left behind.
      </p>
      <p className={getParagraphClass({ responsive: true, muted: true })}>
        And in a strange way, well much like my absolute disdain for coffee and
        mechanical keyboards, I've kind of made peace with it. The older I got,
        the more I realized that being slow is just another way of being
        present. It gives me space and time to notice details others overlook,
        and to let things settle instead of rushing past them.
      </p>
      <p className={getParagraphClass({ responsive: true, muted: true })}>
        Maybe that's all the point really: the things that make me different are
        the same things that make me, me basically.
      </p>
      <p className={getAllowanceClass({ axis: "py" })}></p>
      <h3 className={getHeadingClass(3, { responsive: true })}>
        Function over Form.
      </h3>
      <p className={getParagraphClass({ responsive: true, muted: true })}>
        For some compelling reason, this is something I always keep coming back
        to. I've never been the guy obsessed with appearances for their own
        sake: the shine and all the flashy stuff. For me, if something doesn't
        work, it really doesn't matter how beautiful it looks. A tool should be
        useful before it's aesthetic, as a principle should be lived before it's
        performed.
      </p>
      <p className={getParagraphClass({ responsive: true, muted: true })}>
        Maybe that's precisely why I don't mind being slow to learn, as it
        forces me to prioritize function, and I do that not because I want to
        show off in any way, but because I can use it effectively when the time
        comes (or purely out of the need for curiosity and obsession).
      </p>
      <p className={getAllowanceClass({ axis: "py" })}></p>
      <h3 className={getHeadingClass(3, { responsive: true })}>
        I'm not trying to be meticulously perfect, I'm just trying to pay
        attention.
      </h3>
      <p className={getParagraphClass({ responsive: true, muted: true })}>
        Pay attention to the way I work, the way I learn and think. I try not to
        get caught up in optimizing for speed or following the trend train, but
        to stay in love with the process I chose. Some days that means spending
        hours optimizing a process, other days it's loosely sketching out
        half-formed ideas and letting them percolate as much as they can.
      </p>
      <p className={getParagraphClass({ responsive: true, muted: true })}>
        What I'm still figuring out though is how to trust my own timing, and
        how to know when I'm being thorough versus when I'm just procrastinating
        with research.
      </p>
      <p className={getAllowanceClass({ axis: "py" })}></p>
      <h3 className={getHeadingClass(3, { responsive: true })}>
        I see myself as a collector of sorts.
      </h3>
      <p className={getParagraphClass({ responsive: true, muted: true })}>
        Not of things in the material sense, but of stuff I find either
        intriguing or compelling. It could be a brutalist building or a well
        designed fit.
      </p>
      <p className={getParagraphClass({ responsive: true, muted: true })}>
        That's what{" "}
        <TransitionLink
          href="/catalog"
          className="text-neutral-800 dark:text-neutral-200"

        </TransitionLink>{" "}
        is for, and it's my personal organic archive of beautiful, odd, and
        stuff I term to be "meaningful". It's also where I keep the things that
        taught me something, even if I can't always articulate what that
        something is. You'd probably learn more about how my mind works by
        browsing through it than by reading this monologue.
      </p>
      <p className={getParagraphClass({ responsive: true, muted: true })}>
        So if you've landed here, maybe you're wired a little like me too, and
        you can relate to building large stuff with mini, intentional and
        incremental steps, or you also probably get excited by questions that
        don't have clean and linear answers.
      </p>
      <p className={getParagraphClass({ responsive: true, muted: true })}>
        If any of that resonates with you, I'm glad you're here.
      </p>
      <p className={getParagraphClass({ responsive: true, muted: true })}>
