        This is my personal ritual of reflecting, and making sense of the week's
        learning journey.
      </p>

      <p className={getParagraphClass({ responsive: true, muted: true })}>
        This space helps me stay grounded in the process, celebrate small wins,
        and spot the bigger themes in my learning. It's also a way to crystalize
        ideas by writing them out, which is usually a long never-ending list of
        new concepts, lessons from failed experiments, or links I don't want to
        lose track of.
      </p>

      <p className={getParagraphClass({ responsive: true, muted: true })}>
        Most of all, it keeps me honest and consistent â€” by learning in public,
        but at my own pace.
